# House-price-prediction

House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more.

Goal:

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its characteristics, allowing for more informed decision-making in the real estate market.

Features:

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R-squared)
- Comparison of different machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Model Performance:

- Achieved a RMSE of $X on the test set
- Achieved a R-squared value of Y on the test set

Future Work:

- Incorporate additional features (e.g. neighborhood data, economic indicators)
- Experiment with deep learning models
- Deploy model as a web application
